    Zype API documentation provides information to web developers who wish to use Zypeâ€™s
    Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The Zype API includes modules for
    managing videos and associated metadata. In addition, this reference describes a
    number of related objects. The Zype API is a RESTful API service.

    Our API is designed around standard REST CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) semantics:

    **POST** - Create a resource within a given collection

    **GET** - Get a resource or collection of resources

    **PUT** - Update a resource

    **DELETE** - Delete a resource

    Our default is to support JSON formatting, however if you prefer XML use the
    Content-Type header with value text/xml.
